# About Me Page

**This is my first hosted website and it is about me.** This repository contains my personal "about me" webpage, which will be linked from my portfolio.

This is a simple static website that tells visitors about me, my background, and my journey into web development. It also includes a link (currently under construction) to my portfolio.
